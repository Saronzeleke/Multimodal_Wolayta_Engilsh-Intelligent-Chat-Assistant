who is the last king of wolayta,Tona(1890-1894)
who is the last king of ethiopia,"The last king of pre-colonial Ethiopia was King Tona of the Wolaita Kingdom. He reigned from 1890-1894.  However, the article states that after King Menilik II's conquest of Wolaita in 1894, the status of Wolaita's king was decreased from kingship to balabat. 

So while King Tona was the last king of the independent Wolaita Kingdom, he was deposed by King Menilik II and Wolaita became a sub-province or awraja under the Ethiopian Empire. King Menilik II would then be considered the last king of a unified pre-colonial Ethiopia before it became an empire under Emperor Menilik II.

In summary:
- King Tona was the last king of the independent Wolaita Kingdom (1890-1894)
- After 1894, Wolaita became a sub-province under the Ethiopian Empire 
- King Menilik II, who conquered Wolaita, became Emperor Menilik II and can be considered the last king of a unified pre-colonial Ethiopia before it became an empire.

Hope this summary helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
